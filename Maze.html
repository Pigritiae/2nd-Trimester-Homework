<!--Files have not met half of the objectives proposed in Maze.js.
I made too many mistakes in hindsight, dallyed too much not knowing 
that CoPilot had a monthly limit, spent too much time trying to 
create good models from THREE instead of using or making 3D model 
assets, and relied too much on AI for assistance.-->
